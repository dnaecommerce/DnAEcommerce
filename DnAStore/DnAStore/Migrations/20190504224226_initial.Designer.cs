Because it is young — excavated by an asteroid or comet impact in the late Copernican, probably less than 100 million years ago — its rim is sharp, its impact melt flows and ponds are obvious, and the boulders strewn over the surface around it are prominent.When it comes to rock types, the real estate mantra \"location, location, location\" applies to Eimmart A.The crater, located at 24.12ºN, 65.62ºE, sits on the rim of 25 - mile - wide(40 - kilometer - wide) Eimmart crater, which is in 93 - mile - long(150 - kilometer - long) Mare Anguis(the Serpent Sea), which in turn overlies ejecta from the 345 - mile - wide(555 - kilometer - wide) Mare Crisium impact basin.This means that dark rocks that occur mainly on the east side of Eimmart A are Mare Anguis basalts, while lighter Crisium rocks make up the west side. Eimmart A is \"two-faced\" in other ways. The south and east flanks include many boulders, but melt deposits are small. The north and west flanks include some boulders, but a pair of three-kilometer - long melt flows dominate these areas.The south interior wall includes large outcrops: one triangular outcrop, 600 meters long, is the largest of any found on the Moon in a crater in Eimmart A's size range. The north, east, and west walls have smaller outcrops or none at all. What makes them so different?",

                            Description = "Oblique (very!) view of a crater on the far side of the Moon, as imaged by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Known as the Einthoven cold spot crater, it is located at 109.91° E, 6.74° S. White rays and the crater's rocky rim and rugged interior wall are visible signs of youth. A \"cold spot anomaly\" surrounding the crater is another sign of youth. The anomaly extends far beyond the three-kilometer width of this image, but is invisible to human eyes.The LRO spacecraft explores the Moon using seven scientific instruments, including the LRO Camera(LROC) package, which obtained this image.The seven instruments collect different kinds of scientific data.Combining their data sets allows scientists to make discoveries they never could if they were limited to a single lunar-orbiting instrument.Since 2009, the heat-sensing Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment on LRO has systematically mapped the Moon's surface temperatures, enabling reseachers to chart more than 2200 anomalous cold spots between 50° N and 50° S latitude. The cold spot anomalies appear after the Sun goes down.The Diviner instrument sees the cold spots as irregular splotches that rapidly radiate heat after sunset until they are up to 10° Fahrenheit colder than the surrounding landscape. LROC, observing in the visible part of the spectrum, sees nothing unusual at cold spot locations. When the Sun rises, the spots rapidly warm to the temperature of their surroundings and blend in with the background.What causes cold spot anomalies? In most cases, Diviner data are of too low a resolution to confirm a source.When Diviner data are overlaid on higher - resolution LROC images, however, researchers find that almost all occur around impact craters that are young(less than one million years) and small(from 43 meters to 2300 meters across).We know the craters are young because they have very rocky floors and rims and are surrounded by bright rays. The steady infall of debris from space has not yet had time to chip away these signs of youth.This leads researchers to conclude that a process related to the formation of small craters creates the cold spot anomalies. But what process?Einthoven cold spot crater is 1143 m wide, or about the size of Meteor Crater in Arizona.So far, it has no official name — we call it Einthoven cold spot crater because it is just south of Einthoven crater, which is old, degraded, and, at 69 kilometers in diameter, the largest crater in the neighborhood.Though craters associated with cold spot anomalies are small, the cold spots themselves are often large.The Einthoven cold spot crater anomaly takes in 2070 square kilometers of terrain and extends up to 50 kilometers from the crater. That's much too large an area for ejecta from the crater to cover, which eliminates the most obvious cold spot formation hypothesis: that material blasted from the crater during its formation could create the cold spot.So, how to explain the cold spot anomalies? Some researchers invoke a cascading series of tiny secondary impacts traveling outward from the crater-forming asteroid impact, while others believe that gas produced by the impact flows through the top layer of lunar surface material. Either process might \"fluff up\" the surface, changing the way heat affects it.Few researchers, however, find these explanations to be 100 % convincing.",

The fact that the deepest material lands on top of the shallowest material(known as inverted stratigraphy) was first described by Gene Shoemaker from his pioneering observations at Meteor Crater, Arizona.This effect simplifies sampling the local geology in three dimensions. As an astronaut traverses towards the rim of a crater, the rocks underfoot come from deeper and deeper within the crater. The rocks at the rim are from the deepest portions of the crater!In effect, nature is providing an easy way to observe and sample materials that would otherwise be buried.",

The image is about 11 miles (18 kilometers) wide.LROC team scientists, led by Prasun Mahanti, continue their quest to understand the most common class of lunar surface feature: small impact craters.The Moon lacks a protective atmosphere, so objects - mostly bits of asteroids and comets - which would form short-lived meteors or bright fireballs high in Earth's atmosphere survive to strike the Moon's surface and blast out craters.Millions upon millions of small craters pock the lunar surface.In a paper published in the planetary science journal Icarus, the Mahanti team reported results of a study of small crater populations at two Apollo sites. The Descartes study area. centered on the Apollo 16 landing point located at 8.9734°S latitude, 15.5011°E longitude, is a highlands site astronauts John Young and Charlie Duke explored in April 1972.

These images enabled Mahanti's team to examine in great detail craters measuring from 35 to 200 meters wide. The scientists studied 2568 craters at Descartes and 2543 craters at Taurus-Littrow in that size range.The LROC scientists compared and catalogued the shape of small craters to better understand how erosion takes place in the top few meters of the regolith (soil). They grouped the craters into three basic classes. \"A\" craters are the least degraded, with sharp rims and bowl-shaped interiors. \"C\" craters are the most degraded, with no rims and shallow, funnel-shaped profiles. \"B\" craters fall in-between.They have rims lower than \"A\" craters and are more bowl-shaped than \"C\" craters.The shapes indicate how much erosion has taken place.",
